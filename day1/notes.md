GitHub Administration Steps
‚úÖ Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

    Email: kkeducationblr@gmail.com
    Password: P@a
    Username: kkeducation1234567
    Public URL: https://github.com/
    Enterprise URL: https://airtel.github.com/

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Always use strong passwords and enable 2FA for security.

‚úÖ Step 2: Log in to GitHub

    Navigate to GitHub Login
    Enter your credentials and access the dashboard.

‚úÖ Step 3: Create an Organization

    Organization Name: bsnl-4g-test
    Add service accounts only (not personal emails):
        ‚ùå kkeducationblr@gmail.com
        ‚ùå prasanth@bsnl.com
        ‚úÖ devops4g@bsnl.com

‚úÖ Step 4: Create Repositories

Create both public and private repositories under the organization.

    üîí Private Repo: testing-private-repo
    üåê Public Repo: testing-public-repo

‚úÖ Step 5: Create Teams

Create specific teams for access and collaboration:

    Dev Team: bsnl-dev-team
    DevOps Team: bsnl-DevOps-Team
    (Optional): QA, SRE, DB, etc.

‚úÖ Step 6: Add Users to Teams

Assign GitHub usernames or verified email addresses to each team:

    bsnl-dev-team: Developers
    bsnl-DevOps-Team: Infra and automation
    bsnl-qa-team: QA Engineers
    bsnl-sre-team: Site Reliability Engineers
    bsnl-db-team: DB Admins

‚úÖ Step 7: Grant Repository Access to Teams

Configure repository permissions for each team:

    Read, Write, or Admin privileges as needed.
    Example:
        Devs: Read/Write
        DevOps: Admin
        QA: Read
        DB: Read/Write

‚úÖ Step 8: Manage Access & Clean-up

    Convert Repository Visibility:
        Public ‚Üî Private (can be changed anytime under repo settings)

    Delete:
        Users
        Teams
        Repositories
        Organization (if no longer required)

    Note: Deletion is permanent. Take backup or transfer ownership before deletion.

Additional Best Practices

    Enable branch protection rules.
    Enforce code reviews before merging.
    Setup webhooks or GitHub Actions for automation.
    Regularly review audit logs for access tracking.
    Use service accounts for automation instead of personal credentials.
